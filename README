How to to run the application:

Open application on Netbeans or eclipse and start the chat server ChatServer.java
Run any number of chat instances by running the ChatApplication.java

If you have to run this on a commandline after compilation, you will need to specify the path for the beans-binding library.

Say:

java -cp /path/to-beans-binding.jar com.zizi.ChatServer //to start the server
java -cp /path/to-beans-binding.jar com.zizi.ChatApplication //to start the client
